This project is a collection of solutions for a computational physics competition, all written in Python. The project covers a range of tasks, including verifying Kepler's laws, computing and plotting elliptical orbits of planets, creating 2D and 3D animations of planetary orbits, and using Simpson's numeric integration method to determine how orbital time varies with polar angle. 

Also it includes a Solar System spirograph task, where a pair of planets are chosen and their orbits are plotted against time. Additionally, the project includes a task to plot the orbits of all the bodies in the Solar System, with a chosen object at the origin of a Cartesian coordinate system. This project is a great resource for improving your problem-solving skills, ability to translate mathematical concepts to code, object-oriented design, mastery of Python, data visualization, 3D graphics, animation, and computational modeling.
